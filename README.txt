# Order Cache Implementation - Instructions

## Overview

Your task is to implement an in-memory cache for order objects, facilitating
operations like adding, removing, and matching buy and sell orders. This
simulates a basic trading platform.

- An "order" is a request to buy or sell a financial security (eg. bond, stock,
  commodity, etc.).
- Each order is uniquely identified by an order id.
- Each security has a different security id.
- Order matching occurs for orders with the same security id, different side
  (buy or sell), and different company (company of person who requested the
  order).

## Objectives

- Implement an `OrderCache` class, conforming to the `OrderCacheInterface` in
  `OrderCache.h`.
- Support operations on financial security orders, uniquely identified by
  order IDs.
- Ensure order matching rules are followed (detailed below).

## Development Guidelines

### Order Class

- Provided in `OrderCache.h`. Do not alter existing members.
- You may add extra members if necessary.

### OrderCacheInterface Implementation

- Derive your `OrderCache` class from `OrderCacheInterface`.
- Choose efficient data structures for storing orders.
- Implement the specified methods without changing their signatures:
  - `addOrder()`
  - `cancelOrder()`
  - `cancelOrdersForUser()`
  - `cancelOrdersForSecIdWithMinimumQty()`
  - `getMatchingSizeForSecurity()`
  - `getAllOrders()`
- Feel free to add any additional methods or variables.

### Testing

- Use the provided unit test in `OrderCacheTest.cpp`.
- Refer to `TESTING.txt` for test execution details.
- Run the unit test before submitting.

### Submission

- Submit your source code files via email.
- If your implementation use more files than OrderCache.h and OrderCache.cpp
  then include a CMakeLists.txt or Makefile with instructions to compile
  your code to run the OrderCacheTest.

### Additional Information

- Use up to C++17 standards.
- Ensure the code is platform-agnostic.
- Single-threaded support is mandatory. Multithreading is optional.

## Order Matching Rules for getMatchingSizeForSecurity()

- Match orders with the same security ID and opposite types (Buy/Sell).
- An order can match against multiple orders of the opposite type.
- A buy order can match against multiple sell orders, and vice versa.
- Any order quantity already allocated to a match cannot be reused as a match
  against a different order.
- Some orders may not match entirely or at all.
- Users in the same company cannot match against each other.
- Full details and examples below.

## Order Matching Examples

- Three detailed examples are included to guide you through expected
  functionality and order matching scenarios.

### Example 1:

Orders in cache:
  OrdId1 SecId1 Buy  1000 User1 CompanyA
  OrdId2 SecId2 Sell 3000 User2 CompanyB
  OrdId3 SecId1 Sell  500 User3 CompanyA
  OrdId4 SecId2 Buy   600 User4 CompanyC
  OrdId5 SecId2 Buy   100 User5 CompanyB
  OrdId6 SecId3 Buy  1000 User6 CompanyD
  OrdId7 SecId2 Buy  2000 User7 CompanyE
  OrdId8 SecId2 Sell 5000 User8 CompanyE

Total quantity matching for securities:
  SecId1 0
  SecId2 2700
  SecId3 0

Explanation:
- SecId1
  - SecId1 has 1 Buy order and 1 Sell order
  - Both orders are for users in CompanyA so they are not allowed to match
  - There are no matches for SecId1
- SecId2
  - OrdId2 matches quantity 600 against OrdId4
  - OrdId2 matches quantity 2000 against OrdId7
  - OrdId2 has a total matched quantity of 2600
  - OrdId8 matches quantity 100 against OrdId5 only
  - OrdId8 has a remaining qty of 4900
  - OrdId4 had its quantity fully allocated to match OrdId2
  - No remaining qty on OrdId4 for the remaining 4900 of OrdId8
  - Total quantity matched for SecId2 is 2700. (2600 + 100)
  - Note: there are other combinations of matches among the orders which
    would lead to the same result of 2700 total qty matching
- SecId3 has only one Buy order, no other orders to match against

### Example 2:

Orders in cache:
  OrdId1  SecId1 Sell  100 User10 Company2
  OrdId2  SecId3 Sell  200 User8  Company2
  OrdId3  SecId1 Buy   300 User13 Company2
  OrdId4  SecId2 Sell  400 User12 Company2
  OrdId5  SecId3 Sell  500 User7  Company2
  OrdId6  SecId3 Buy   600 User3  Company1
  OrdId7  SecId1 Sell  700 User10 Company2
  OrdId8  SecId1 Sell  800 User2  Company1
  OrdId9  SecId2 Buy   900 User6  Company2
  OrdId10 SecId2 Sell 1000 User5  Company1
  OrdId11 SecId1 Sell 1100 User13 Company2
  OrdId12 SecId2 Buy  1200 User9  Company2
  OrdId13 SecId1 Sell 1300 User1  Company1

Total quantity matching for securities:
  SecId1 300
  SecId2 1000
  SecId3 600

### Example 3:

Orders in cache:
  OrdId1  SecId3 Sell  100 User1 Company1
  OrdId2  SecId3 Sell  200 User3 Company2
  OrdId3  SecId1 Buy   300 User2 Company1
  OrdId4  SecId3 Sell  400 User5 Company2
  OrdId5  SecId2 Sell  500 User2 Company1
  OrdId6  SecId2 Buy   600 User3 Company2
  OrdId7  SecId2 Sell  700 User1 Company1
  OrdId8  SecId1 Sell  800 User2 Company1
  OrdId9  SecId1 Buy   900 User5 Company2
  OrdId10 SecId1 Sell 1000 User1 Company1
  OrdId11 SecId2 Sell 1100 User6 Company2

Total quantity matching for securities:
  SecId1 900
  SecId2 600
  SecId3 0

## Performance

- Carefully select the datastructure to optimize the performance of the cache.
- Avoid storing pointers due to increased complexity and safety issues.
- Focus on optimizing getMatchingSizeForSecurity() for speed. Ideally aim for a
  time complexity of O(n) or better such as O(log n) where n is the number of
  orders in the cache.
- Carefully consider each operation that is made when adding and calculating
  order matching size.
- Performance is measured Normalized Compute Units (NCUs).
- Your solution must be able to process (adding and matching) up to 1,000,000
  orders in 1,500 NCUs or less.
- Use the included unit test to check that your solution is performant.

## Conclusion

Focus on writing clean and optimized code that adheres to the provided
specifications and passes all unit tests.

Good luck with your implementation!
